<p>You there! You look like you've fought a Dire Chicken or two back in your day. How did I know? You've got that hardened look in your eye, like: "I've seen one too many Dire Chickens." Or perhaps several. But you know what? You've got courage, 'cause you haven't stopped reading this description yet. It's a low bar, sure, but that's what I like about ya... you don't value your time all that much. Nope, not even a little. Not even the teensiest, slightist, most insignificant, tiiiiiny little amount. Nope, not at all. In fact, you're probably a little slow, to be honest. Anyways...</p>

<p>Crawl through randomized dungeons with your friends in the quest for magical loot! Slaughter hordes of innocent monsters with unique and interesting spells! Explore new, procedurally generated "Areas" as one of three classes and four races! Invest into your stats and skills however you see fit! Explore a mysterious new dimension that sweeps across the sky! Tame the ever-so-illustrious Dire Chicken! (Metaphorically, duh. I mean, it's not like you can be FRIENDS with them... or ride around on their cute little chicken backs... and breed them and raise them from hatchlings... I mean, that'd just be ridiculous.) And uh, finally, reinvent your entire experience with Spellscript, a scripting language that lets you create new classes, spells, and more!</p>

<p>All this can be YOURS for the low, low price of actually donating to Frizzil, you cheap bastards! GEEZ. (I'm just kidding... I know you'd never actually donate. (Unless you did donate, in which case, innocent Dire Chickens will not have to brutally starve to death, so thank you very, very much.))</p>
